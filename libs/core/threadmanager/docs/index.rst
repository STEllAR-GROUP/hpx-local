==============

This module defines the :cpp:class:`hpx::threads::threadmanager` class. This is
used by the runtime to manage the creation and destruction of thread pools. The
:ref:`modules_resource_partitioner` module handles the partitioning of resources
into thread pools, but not the creation of thread pools.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_thread_manager_api>` of this module for more
details.
