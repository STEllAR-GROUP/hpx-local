==============

This module contains the base class definition required for threads. The base
class :cpp:class:`hpx::threads::thread_data` is inherited by two specializations
for stackful and stackless threads:
:cpp:class:`hpx::threads::thread_data_stackful` and
:cpp:class:`hpx::threads::thread_data_stackless`. In addition, the module
defines the base classes for schedulers and thread pools:
:cpp:class:`hpx::threads::policies::scheduler_base` and
:cpp:class:`hpx::threads::thread_pool_base`.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_thread_data_api>` of this module for more
details.
