==================
batch_environments
==================

This module allows for the detection of execution as batch jobs, a series of
programs executed without user intervention. All data is preselected and will
be executed according to preset parameters, such as date or completion of
another task. Batch environments are especially useful for executing repetitive
tasks.

|hpx| supports the creation of batch jobs through the Portable Batch System
(PBS) and SLURM.

For more information on batch environments, see :ref:`running_on_batch_systems`
and the :ref:`API reference <modules_batch_environments_api>` for the module.
