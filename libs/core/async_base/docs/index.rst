==========

The async_base module defines the basic functionality for spawning tasks on
thread pools. This module does not implement any functionality on its own, but
is extended by :ref:`modules_async_local` and :ref:`modules_async_distributed` with
implementations for the local and distributed cases.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_async_base_api>` of this module for more
details.
