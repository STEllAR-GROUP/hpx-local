===
HPX
===

HPX is a C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism. It implements all
of the corresponding facilities as defined by the C++ Standard. Additionally, in
HPX we implement functionalities proposed as part of the ongoing C++
standardization process. We also extend the C++ Standard APIs to the distributed
case.

HPXLocal is a sub-project of `HPX <https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx>`_
providing on-node functionality, including synchronization primitives and
parallel algorithms. HPXLocal can be used standalone, as a system dependency of
HPX, or cloned transparently by the HPX build system. See the `HPX documentation
<https://hpx-docs.stellar-group.org/latest/html/index.html>`_ for more details
about installing and using HPX and HPXLocal.

Governance
==========

The HPX project is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone
with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the
project design and participate in the decision making process.
`This document <http://hpx.stellar-group.org/documents/governance/>`_ describes
how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within
the project community.
