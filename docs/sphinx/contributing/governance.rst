.. _governance:

======================
|hpx| governance model
======================

The |hpx| project is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone
with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the
project design and participate in the decision making process.
`This document <http://hpx.stellar-group.org/documents/governance/>`_ describes
how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within
the project community.
